# A-Novel-Deep-Learning-Framework-Approach-for-Waste-Segregation

This is a research project in which we applied Convolutional Neural Network on image-dataset.
The dataset consists of two classes of waste, that is, Biodegradable waste and Non-biodegradable waste.
Dataset consists of about 250 images of each class.
We proposed a deep learning algorithm which can classify wastes into biodegradable and non-biodegradable upto 98% correct.
